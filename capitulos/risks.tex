		Description & Changes to an API could affect this project directly or indirectly. Programs could fail or not work as expected.
		In a project that does not work in a bleeding edge environment, like this, this should be very rare and even if it were to happen it would have to interfere with the part of the API this project uses, which (as this is not bleeding edge) normally would be backwards compatible.\\ \hline

		\vspace{-0.5em}
		\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{0em}
			\item Wrong baselines
			\item Wrong identification of the configuration elements
			\item It takes more time than expected to manage the project
			\item Wrong use of the tools
			\item Too much time between commits
			\item Changes are unclear
